                Ally works to prevent human trafficking and help survivors
                rebuild their lives. In Canada, our focus is to prevent
                exploitation and human trafficking by empowering individuals and
                communities with essential information about what this issue
                looks like locally. We are working alongside organizations and
                individuals with lived experience across Canada to expand the
                research in this area and to develop survivor-informed
                educational resourcesâ€”like The Prevention Project.
